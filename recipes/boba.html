  <h1>World's Best Boba Recipe</h1>
  <img src='boba-picture.jpeg' width='750'>
  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bubble tea is a popular drink invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. 
    Called zhen zhu nai cha in Mandarin—which literally translates 
    to pearl milk tea—the beverage gets its name from the chewy 
    tapioca, or bubbles (boba if you're from the West Coast), 
    that are mixed in.</p>
    
    <p>If you love going out for bubble tea, you can use this easy recipe 
    to make a batch of your own at home. It'll not only save you money 
    but going the DIY route will allow you to flavor the tea to your 
    liking. A classic version calls for black tea, milk, syrup, and 
    tapioca, but you can reduce the amount of sugar or use soy or 
    almond milk in place of regular dairy.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>3 cups water</li>
    <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>

    <li>4 large ice cubes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Boil the water in a large pot. Add the pearls and boil
